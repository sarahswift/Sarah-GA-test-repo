        <h1>Croatia</h1>
        <p>My two friends and I stayed for 5 days in an apartment in Old Town Dubrovnik and took many day trips from there. Then we spent 2 days and 1 night in an apartment on the island of Korcula, a bit north of Dubrovnik. Then we spent 3 final days at a hotel in Dubrovnik but about 3 miles out from Old Town. So most of the below tips and sights are all places close to Dubrovnik.</p>

        <h2>Elaphiti Islands</h2>
        <p>The best way to see and visit the Elaphiti Islands is by boat. You'll see many people offering boat tours to the islands from the Old Port. We booked a private sailing tour with Loren, who was recommended to us by the owner of the apartment which we rented. I emailed Loren about two weeks in advance of our trip to reserve a date and then doubly confirmed with him a couple days before. He is a great tour guide! Very knowledgable and an excellent boat driver, and also very flexible, happy to customize the tour to your needs and wishes. Here was his original email to me detailing the tours he offers:<br>"So we have full day trips around Dubrovnik Islands ( elafiti ) We visit 4 islands in 8h excursion. On the start We do panorama of the old town and then we go to elafiti islands visit caves, beaches, ports of every Island and of course stop anywhere you want. So it is a private boat. The price is from 200e for 4hours to 300euro for 8h trip. Skipper and fuel included. Snorkeling equipment and underwater camera included also. I'm sending you a photo of the boats."

        <h2>Lokrum</h2>
        <p>A must see! Hourly ferries from Old Town Port. 20 min ride each way, very quick and easy to get to. We went ourselves, not on a formal tour. The island is magical with peacocks roaming freely, lots of forest areas, a botanical garden, a small dead see, a few bars and small beach restaurants, and a few rocky beaches. Somehow the island has all of these things, yet is very small and easy to navigate.</p>

        <h2>Cavtat</h2>
        <p>Super fun. This is a port town south of Dubrovnik where all of the large yachts come in to dock. Hourly ferries from Old Town Port. 45 min ride each way, really beautiful views on the way there. There is a mausoleum at the top of a hill on the tip of Cavtat which has gorgeous views of the entire harbor. Because this is a yacht destination there are many nice restaurants. We went to Ankora wine bar for lunch and it was delicious. Right in the harbor so you can watch the yachts dock as you eat. There are several beaches with chairs and also kayaks to rent. The whole area feels more resort-ish than Lokrum which feels more secluded. We enjoyed having a day in each place.</p>
