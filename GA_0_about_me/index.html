<h2>Hi, I'm Sarah!</h2>
<p>
	By day, I live in New York City and work in the tech industry as a design producer. Recently, I am finding that my true passion is traveling the world. This is not entirely surprising considering my Dad was in the Navy for forty years and literally made laps around the globe. My mother was a reporter for a few different international news outlets, and my brother was most recently teaching English in Beijing. We're a family that is most comfortable when we are thousands of miles away from "home"
	</p>
<p>
	Over the past few years I've made trips from San Francisco to Shanghai to Sydney, and a few places in between. I started capturing my trip itineraries and pictures in Google Docs which I shared with family and friends. These Google Docs were seemingly so well received that I decided to make them into a blog. And because I'm a type-A, over-achieving, go-getter New Yorker, I decide to write and code this blog from scratch. And here we are :)
